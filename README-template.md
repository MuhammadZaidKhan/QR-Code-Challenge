What I Learned
During this project, I had the opportunity to explore and learn several key concepts and techniques. Here are the major learnings:

Creating a <div> element in HTML to organize and structure content.
Applying CSS styles to HTML elements to control their appearance and layout.
Using flexbox to center elements horizontally and vertically within a container.
Placing an image inside a container using the <img> tag.
Adjusting the dimensions of elements using CSS properties like width, height, and max-width.
Styling text by using properties such as text-align, font-weight, and font-family.
Creating spacing and borders around elements using CSS properties like margin and border.
Understanding how to use classes and selectors to target specific elements.
Writing clean and organized code by properly indenting and structuring HTML and CSS.
Overall, this project provided hands-on experience in HTML and CSS, enabling me to build a vertical card with an image and text. I now have a better understanding of creating layouts, styling elements, and utilizing various CSS properties to achieve the desired design.
